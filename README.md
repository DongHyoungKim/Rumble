## Getting Started

**Git clone repo
**You will first need to create a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory**. This will store all of the environment variables we need for this project, including the port on which to run the Node.js server as well as all of the set-up for the
Firebase/Firestore stuff. 


Then, install all the node modules, as usual:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see a message that says:
```bash
Node.js server listening on port PORT...
```

Open http://localhost:PORT with your browser to see the result.

## Working with Firestore

In order to access the Firestore Database admin panel (really useful for seeing if you're adding/removing data properly or to manually do so), click [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
